 - User can select movie/price
 - User can select/deselect multiple seats
 - User can't select occupies seat
 - Number of seats and price will update based on selected movie and number of seats.
 - Save seats, movie and price to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh (Means the seats, price or movie wouldn't     change on refresh and gets stored on the local storage.)
